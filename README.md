# Awdeo (Flutter + BLoC + Firebase)
 - AWDEO is a noncommercial audio streamer, designed to listen to music without ads or subscriptions. Made for people who just want to press play and listen.
 - This project introduced me to the world of modern app development, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with Flutter, BLoC architecture, and Firebase integration.
